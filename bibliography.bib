  abstract = {As the area of use for blockchain technology is rapidly spreading, a digitized democratic voting
system might just be the next revolutionary step towards a transparent and trusted electoral
system.
This thesis investigates the possibility of a decentralized voting system and explores the possible challenges regarding privacy, correctness and integrity. Using the Ethereum blockchain and
various smart contracts, a prototype was implemented as a proof of concept. The thesis also
contains studies regarding the social- and environmental aspects of the prototype and electronic
voting in general.
Throughout the project, it became clear that the suggested implementation has essential tradeoffs and would not work in practice. The study concretizes what needs to be improved in order
to use a voting system built on blockchain technology. This report concludes that there is still
work to be done in order to use this technology in crucial fields such as voting. And suggests
using a private blockchain in order to implement the specified voting system, DeVote.},

  abstract = {It had been predicted that by 2020, nearly 26 billion devices would be connected to the Internet, with a big percentage being vehicles. The Internet of Vehicles (IoVa) is a concept that refers to the connection and cooperation of smart vehicles and devices in a network through the generation, transmission, and processing of data that aims at improving traffic congestion, travel time, and comfort, all the while reducing pollution and accidents. However, this transmission of sensitive data (e.g., location) needs to occur with defined security properties to safeguard vehicles and their drivers since attackers could use this data. Blockchain is a fairly recent technology that guarantees trust between nodes through cryptography mechanisms and consensus protocols in distributed, untrustful environments, like IoV networks. Much research has been done in implementing the former in the latter to impressive results, as Blockchain can cover and offer solutions to many IoV problems. However, these implementations have to deal with the challenge of IoV node's resource constraints since they do not suffice for the computational and energy requirements of traditional Blockchain systems, which is one of the biggest limitations of Blockchain implementations in IoV. Finally, these two technologies can be used to build the foundations for smart cities, enabling new application models and better results for end-users.},

  abstract = {Electronic voting systems provide many advantages over traditional ballot based voting systems mainly over the accuracy and speed of the tallying process of the voting. However, electronic voting systems suffer from many technical and security issues which have limited its deployment in voting scenarios such as company voting and political elections. Centralized electronic voting systems are, by nature not secure, and there are many avenues of cyber-attacks that could tamper the voting result. Electronic voting system should be highly secured, tampered-proof guaranteed, and the voting should be trusted worthy. In this study, we propose BlockVOTE, a Blockchain-based electronic voting system. Our proposal uses Blockchain to ensure that the voting process can be kept secure and trustable through the consensus handling mechanism of the Blockchain. The architecture design and implementation suggestion are provided in this study. The implementation of the proposal was developed and tested via experimentation. The experiment result and the discussion on the possibility of adopting our proposal in an actual election is provided at the end of this study.},

Most existing E-Voting systems are based on centralized servers where the voters must trust the organizing authority for the integrity of the results. In this paper we propose a novel approach for a decentralized trustless voting platform that relies on Blockchain technology to solve the trust issues. The main features of this system include ensuring data integrity and transparency, and enforcing one vote per mobile phone number for every poll with ensured privacy. To accomplish this, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is used as the Blockchain runtime environment, on which transparent, consistent and deterministic smart contracts will be deployed by organizers for each voting event to run the voting rules. Users are authenticated through their mobile phone numbers without the need of a third party server. Results showed that the system is feasible and may offer a step towards ideal environments for such experience.},

  abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},
